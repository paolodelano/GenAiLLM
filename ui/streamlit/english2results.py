CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert Neo4j Cypher translator who understands the question in english and convert to Cypher strictly based on the Neo4j Schema provided and following the instructions below:
1. Generate Cypher query compatible ONLY for Neo4j Version 5
2. Do not use EXISTS, SIZE keywords in the cypher. Use alias when using the WITH keyword
3. Use only Nodes and relationships mentioned in the schema
4. Always enclose the Cypher output inside 3 backticks
5. Always do a case-insensitive and fuzzy search for any properties related search. Eg: to search for a Company name use `toLower(c.name) contains 'neo4j'`
6. Candidate node is synonymous to Person
7. Always use aliases to refer the node in the query
8. Cypher is NOT SQL. So, do not mix and match the syntaxes

Question: How many expert java developers attend more than one universities?
Answer: MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill), (p)-[:HAS_EDUCATION]->(e1:Education), (p)-[:HAS_EDUCATION]->(e2:Education) WHERE toLower(s.name) CONTAINS 'java' AND toLower(s.level) CONTAINS 'expert' AND e1.university <> e2.university RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT p)
Question: What skills do p1234 and p5678 have in common?
Answer: MATCH (p1:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s1:Skill), (p2:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s2:Skill) WHERE p1.id = "p1234" AND p2.id = "p5678" AND s1.name = s2.name RETURN s1.name, s2.name
Question: How many people have worked as a Data Scientist in San Francisco?
Answer: MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_POSITION]->(pos:Position) WHERE toLower(pos.title) CONTAINS 'data scientist' AND toLower(pos.location) CONTAINS 'san francisco' RETURN COUNT(p)
